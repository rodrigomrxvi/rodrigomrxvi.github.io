<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a biomedical engineering scientist interested in the interaction of blood with medical devices. I am working as a postdoc with [James F. Anataki](https://antakilab.bme.cornell.edu/). My main project is the modeling of thrombosis in blood flow regimes relevant for ventricular assist devices and oxygenators. 
Before comming to cornell I did my PhD in France with [Franck Nicoud and Simon Mendez](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~yales2bio/index.html), I was able to contribute to the first thrombosis solver integrated to the YALES2BIO code. Before that, I did my masters project at the [CERFACS](https://cerfacs.fr/en/) performing DNS of the ignition process with the suppervision of Benedicte Cuenot. I did my undergrad in the National Autonomus University of Mexico, my thesis was about the Locomotion of microrobots in complex fluids in the Lab of [Roberto Zenit](https://sites.brown.edu/zenit/)
I enjoy footbal and climbing.
