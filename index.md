<h1 class="text-center">Rodrigo Méndez Rojano, Ph.D.</h1>

<p class="lead text-justify">
I am a scientist in biomedical engineering interested in the interaction of blood with medical devices. I am working as a postdoc with [James F. Anataki](https://antakilab.bme.cornell.edu/). My main project is the modeling of thrombosis in blood flow regimes relevant for ventricular assist devices and oxygenators. 
Before coming to Cornell I did my PhD in France with [Franck Nicoud and Simon Mendez](https://imag.umontpellier.fr/~yales2bio/index.html), I was able to contribute to the first thrombosis solver integrated to the CFD YALES2BIO code. Before that, I did my masters project at the [CERFACS](http://cerfacs.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CFD_rapport_mendezrodrigo.pdf) performing DNS of the ignition process with the supervision of Bénédicte Cuenot. I did my undergrad in the National Autonomous University of Mexico, my thesis was about the Locomotion of microrobots in complex fluids in the Lab of [Roberto Zenit](https://sites.brown.edu/zenit/)
I enjoy football and rock climbing.
